### What is a mnemonic phrase?

**Simple:** It's 24 special words that are like a master key to your wallet. If you lose them, you lose your money forever.

**Technical:** A BIP39 mnemonic phrase is a human-readable representation of your wallet's private key. It's generated using cryptographic randomness and can restore your wallet on any device.

**Example:**
```
apple banana cherry dragon elephant forest
guitar hammer island jungle keyboard lemon
mountain notebook ocean planet question rainbow
sunset thunder umbrella victory whisper xylophone
```

**Important:**
- ✅ Write it on paper
- ✅ Store in multiple safe places
- ❌ Never take photos
- ❌ Never store digitally
- ❌ Never share with anyone

---

### Do I need to provide my email or ID?

**No!** RhizaCore is completely anonymous. You don't need:
- ❌ Email address
- ❌ Phone number
- ❌ Government ID
- ❌ Bank account
- ❌ Credit card (to create wallet)

**Why?** We believe in privacy and self-sovereignty. Your wallet, your control.

---

### Can I use RhizaCore on my phone?

**Currently:** RhizaCore works best on desktop browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).

**Coming Soon:** Native mobile apps for iOS and Android (Q4 2026).

**Workaround:** You can use your phone's browser, but the experience is optimized for desktop.

---

3. Share with sender
4. Wait for payment
5. Money appears in your balance

**Your Address:**

- Like your bank account number

**Example:**
```
EQA1_7xP2B3C4D5E6F7G8H9I0J1K2L3M4N5O6P7Q8R9S0T1U2V3W4X5Y6Z7
```

---

### What are network fees?

**Simple:** A tiny fee (usually $0.01-0.05) paid to the blockchain to process your transaction.

**Technical:** Gas fees compensate validators for processing and securing transactions on the TON network.

**Who Gets the Fee?**
- Not RhizaCore
- Goes to blockchain validators
- Keeps the network running

**Typical Fees:**
- Send TON: ~$0.01
- Send tokens: ~$0.02
- Swap tokens: ~$0.05

---

### Can I cancel a transaction?

**No.** Once a transaction is confirmed on the blockchain, it's permanent and cannot be reversed.

**Why?**
- Blockchain transactions are immutable
- This prevents fraud and double-spending
- It's a core feature of cryptocurrency

**Prevention:**
- Always double-check addresses
- Send small test amounts first
- Verify recipient before sending large amounts

---

### How long do transactions take?

**TON Blockchain:**
- Typical: 5-10 seconds
- Fast: 2-3 seconds
- Slow: 30 seconds (rare)

**Factors Affecting Speed:**
- Network congestion
- Transaction fee
- Blockchain confirmation time

**If Stuck:**
- Wait 1-2 minutes
- Check blockchain explorer
- Contact support if stuck >10 minutes

---

## Security

### How secure is my wallet?

**Very Secure!** RhizaCore uses:
- 🔒 AES-256-GCM encryption (military-grade)
- 🔑 PBKDF2 key derivation (100,000 iterations)
- 🛡️ Non-custodial design (you control keys)
- 🔐 Password protection
- ⏱️ Session timeout (15 minutes)

**What This Means:**
- Your mnemonic is encrypted with your password
- Even if someone steals your device, they can't access your wallet without the password
- RhizaCore never sees or stores your private keys

---

### What is session timeout?

**Simple:** If you don't use your wallet for 15 minutes, it automatically logs you out for security.

**How It Works:**
1. You login to your wallet
2. System tracks your activity (mouse, keyboard, scroll)
3. After 13 minutes of inactivity, you see a warning
4. You have 2 minutes to click "Stay Logged In"
5. If you don't, you're logged out automatically

**Why?**
- Protects you if you forget to logout
- Prevents unauthorized access
- Security best practice

**Disable It?**
- No, it's always active for your protection
- But you can quickly login again

---

### How do I create a strong password?

**Requirements:**
- ✅ At least 8 characters
- ✅ One uppercase letter (A-Z)
- ✅ One lowercase letter (a-z)
- ✅ One number (0-9)
- ✅ One special character (!@#$%^&*)

**Good Examples:**
- `MyWallet2024!`
- `Crypto$ecure99`
- `RhizaP@ssw0rd`
- `T0nW@llet#2026`

**Bad Examples:**
- ❌ `password` (too simple)
- ❌ `12345678` (no letters)
- ❌ `Password` (no numbers/symbols)
- ❌ `qwerty123` (too common)

**Pro Tips:**
- Use a password manager
- Don't reuse passwords
- Make it memorable but complex
- Write it down separately from your mnemonic

---

### What if I forget my password?

**Good News:** You can still access your wallet with your 24-word mnemonic phrase!

**Steps:**
1. Go to "Import Wallet"
2. Enter your 24 words
3. Set a NEW password
4. Your wallet is restored!

**Bad News:** If you lost BOTH your password AND your mnemonic phrase, your wallet cannot be recovered.

**Prevention:**
- Always backup your mnemonic phrase
- Store it in multiple safe places
- Consider a password manager for your password

---

### How do I recognize scams?

**Common Scams:**

**1. Fake Support**
```
❌ "Hi, I'm from RhizaCore support. Send me your 24-word phrase to verify your account."
```
✅ **Real support NEVER asks for your phrase!**

**2. Phishing Websites**
```
❌ rhizacore-wallet.com (fake)
❌ rhiza-core.net (fake)
```
✅ **Always check the URL carefully!**

**3. Too Good to Be True**
```
❌ "Send 1 TON, get 10 TON back!"
❌ "Free airdrop! Just send gas fees!"
```
✅ **If it sounds too good, it's a scam!**

**4. Urgent Messages**
```
❌ "Your wallet will be locked in 24 hours!"
❌ "Verify your account now or lose access!"
```
✅ **Don't panic! Verify first!**

**How to Stay Safe:**
- ✅ Bookmark the real website
- ✅ Never share your 24-word phrase
- ✅ Be skeptical of unsolicited messages
- ✅ Verify URLs before entering info

---

## Troubleshooting

### I forgot my password

2. Enter all 24 words in order
3. Set a new password
4. Your wallet is restored with all funds intact

**If you also lost your mnemonic:**

### I sent to wrong address

**Prevention:**
- Always double-check addresses
- Send small test amounts first
- Use address book for frequent recipients
- Scan QR codes instead of typing

**Possible Recovery:**

## Advanced Features

### What is staking?

**Simple:** Lock up your $RZC coins to earn more coins over time. Like a savings account that pays interest.

**How It Works:**

2. Your coins help secure the network
3. You earn rewards (5-15% APY)
4. After the period, you get your coins back + rewards

**Example:**
```
Stake: 1,000 $RZC for 90 days at 10% APY
Earn: ~25 $RZC in rewards
Total: 1,025 $RZC after 90 days

```
You refer 10 friends
