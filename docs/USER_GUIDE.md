## Getting Started

### What is RhizaCore?

**Simple:** RhizaCore is like a digital wallet where you can store, send, and receive money. You control it completely—no banks needed!

**Technical:** RhizaCore is a non-custodial TON blockchain wallet with multi-wallet management, AES-256-GCM encryption, and self-sovereign key management.

### What You'll Need

- ✅ A computer or smartphone with internet
- ✅ 5 minutes of your time
- ✅ A pen and paper (for your secret phrase)
- ✅ A strong password you'll remember

### Quick Start (3 Steps)

1. **Visit** → [RhizaCore Website]
2. **Click** → "Open Wallet"
3. **Choose** → Create New or Import Existing

---

## Creating Your First Wallet

### Step 1: Start the Process

1. Click **"Open Wallet"** on the homepage
2. On the onboarding page, click **"Create New Wallet"**

### Step 2: Save Your Secret Phrase

**What You'll See:**
- 24 words displayed on screen
- Example: "apple banana cherry..." (but yours will be different!)

**What to Do:**
1. ✍️ **Write down all 24 words** on paper in order
2. 📝 **Number them** (1-24) so you don't mix them up
3. 🔒 **Store the paper safely** (like in a safe or locked drawer)
4. ❌ **Never take a photo** or save digitally

**Why This Matters:**
- These 24 words are the ONLY way to recover your wallet
- If you lose them, your money is gone forever
- RhizaCore cannot help you recover them

**Pro Tip:** Write them on two pieces of paper and store in different safe places!

### Step 3: Create a Password

**What You'll Do:**
1. Enter a strong password (at least 8 characters)
2. Include uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols
3. Confirm your password

**Password Requirements:**
- ✅ At least 8 characters
- ✅ One uppercase letter (A-Z)
- ✅ One lowercase letter (a-z)
- ✅ One number (0-9)
- ✅ One special character (!@#$%^&*)

**Good Password Examples:**
- `MyWallet2024!`
- `Crypto$ecure99`
- `RhizaP@ssw0rd`

**Bad Password Examples:**
- ❌ `password` (too simple)
- ❌ `12345678` (no letters)
- ❌ `Password` (no numbers or symbols)

### Step 4: Verify Your Backup

**What Happens:**
- System asks for 3 random words from your phrase
- Example: "Enter word #5, word #12, and word #19"

**What to Do:**
1. Look at your written paper
2. Find the words at those positions
3. Type them in correctly
4. Click "Verify Backup"

**If You Get It Wrong:**
- Don't panic! You can try again
- Check your paper carefully
- Make sure you're reading the right numbers

### Step 5: Final Confirmation

**What You'll Confirm:**
- ✅ I wrote my phrase on paper
- ✅ I won't take photos or screenshots
- ✅ I understand my password encrypts my wallet
- ✅ I'm responsible for my security

**Then:**
- Click **"Initialize My Vault"**
- Wait a few seconds
- Welcome to your dashboard! 🎉

### Recognizing Scams

**Common Scams:**

   - Real support NEVER asks for your phrase!

2. **Phishing Websites**
   - Fake websites that look like RhizaCore
   - Always check the URL carefully

3. **Too Good to Be True**
   - "Send 1 TON, get 10 back!"
   - If it sounds too good, it's a scam

4. **Urgent Messages**
   - "Your wallet will be locked!"
   - "Verify your account now!"
   - Don't panic, verify first

**How to Stay Safe:**
- ✅ Bookmark the real RhizaCore website
