- One number
- One special character like ! or @

"For example: MyWallet2024! or Crypto$ecure99"

[STEP 4: VERIFY BACKUP - 3:30-4:30]
"Now RhizaCore will test if you really wrote down your phrase. It'll ask for 3 random words."

[SCREEN: Verification challenge]

"Look at your paper, find word #5, word #12, and word #19. Type them in exactly as written."

[SCREEN: Enter words]

"Click 'Verify Backup'. If correct, you'll move to the final step. If wrong, double-check your paper and try again."

[STEP 5: FINAL CONFIRMATION - 4:30-5:30]
"Last step! Read through the security checklist:"

[SCREEN: Confirmation page]

- "I wrote my phrase on paper" ✓
- "I won't take photos or screenshots" ✓

- "I'm responsible for my security" ✓

"Check all boxes, then click 'Initialize My Vault'."

"Congratulations! Your wallet is created!"

[SCREEN: Dashboard]

"You'll see your dashboard with your balance (currently zero), your wallet address, and options to send, receive, and more."
