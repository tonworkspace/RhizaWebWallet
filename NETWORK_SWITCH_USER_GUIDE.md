## FAQ

### Q: Which network should I use?
**A:** Start with Testnet to learn, then switch to Mainnet when ready.

### Q: Will I lose my balance when switching?
**A:** No! Your wallet address is the same on both networks. You'll see different balances because they're separate networks.

### Q: How do I get testnet TON?
**A:** Use a TON testnet faucet (we'll add a link in the app soon).

### Q: Can I have different wallets for each network?
**A:** Your wallet works on both networks. The same address shows different balances on each network.

### Q: Is my real money safe?
**A:** Yes! Mainnet and Testnet are completely separate. Testnet transactions don't affect your real TON.
