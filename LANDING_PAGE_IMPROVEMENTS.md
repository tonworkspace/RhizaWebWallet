# Landing Page Universal Understanding Improvements

## Goal
Make RhizaCore understandable to everyone from age 10 to 100+, both novices and experts.

## Strategy: Layered Communication
- **Primary text**: Simple, clear language anyone can understand
- **Secondary text**: Technical details for experts (in smaller, italic text)

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Hero Section
**Before**: "Institutional-grade commerce protocol on TON. A non-custodial ecosystem..."
**After**: 
- Simple: "A digital wallet where you can shop, save, and send money anywhere in the world."
- Expert: "Non-custodial commerce protocol on TON with institutional-grade infrastructure."

### 2. How It Works (3 Steps)
**Improvements**:
- "Create Your Vault" → "Create Your Wallet" (more familiar term)
- Added simple explanations + technical details for each step
- Example: "Make a secret password (like a super-secure lock)" + "Generate BIP39 mnemonic phrase"

### 3. Business Model Section
**Before**: "Protocol Economics" / "Institutional Architecture"
**After**: "How We Make Money" / "Built to Last"
- Simpler headline with technical subtitle
- Each card now has both simple explanation and technical detail

### 4. Opportunities Section
**Before**: "Your Global Opportunity" / "Cross-Border Arbitrage"
**After**: "What's In It For You?" / "Send Money Anywhere"
- Relatable benefits first
- Technical terms explained in context

## Design Principles Applied

1. **Use Analogies**: Compare to familiar concepts (piggy bank, concert tickets, savings account)
2. **Active Voice**: "You control it" instead of "Non-custodial"
3. **Concrete Examples**: "Buy clothes, electronics, games" instead of "digital goods"
4. **Question Headlines**: "What Can You Do?" engages readers
5. **Benefit-Focused**: Lead with what users get, not technical features
6. **Progressive Disclosure**: Simple first, technical details available but not overwhelming

## Accessibility Features

- Large, clear typography
- Simple sentence structure
- Visual hierarchy (big simple text, small technical text)
- Consistent pattern throughout the page
- No jargon in primary content
- Technical terms always explained

## Result

The landing page now serves multiple audiences simultaneously:
